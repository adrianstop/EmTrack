# EmTrack
Android app EmTrack is supposed to be able to estimate your emission footprint based on your movements. Still very much a WIP.

## Purpose
This project is part of the Mobile Computing Lab (448.066) course at TU Graz, taught by Professor Olga Saukh. More information about the course can be found on the course's GitHub here: https://github.com/osaukh/mobile_computing_lab/.

## Working principle
The app uses your phones accelerometer and gyroscope data fed through an LSTM neural network in TensorFlow Lite to estimate your means of transportation. This is paired with time along with a lookuptable for CO2-emmissions of the typical means of transportation to give you an estimate on how much your transportation CO2 footprint is. 

At least thats the idea for now.

To be continued...
